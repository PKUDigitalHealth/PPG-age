# PPG-age
[Commun. Med. 2025] Artificial intelligence-derived photoplethysmography age as a digital biomarker for cardiovascular health

Wearable devices can measure tiny changes in blood flow using light. We developed a computer method that turns this information into a measure called “PPG age”, which shows how old the blood vessels appear. In our study of over 200,000 people, those with a PPG age much higher than their actual age were more likely to develop heart problems, such as coronary heart disease. People with a younger PPG age had lower risks. Tracking changes in this measure over time also provided useful clues about future health. Because it works with simple wearable sensors, this approach could support large-scale heart health screening and personalized prevention in everyday life.
